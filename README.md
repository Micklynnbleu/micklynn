1. Problem Statement.
The problem is to design an algorithmic solution for efficient inventory management in a retail store. The solution should involve tracking sales, calculating reorder points, monitoring stock levels, initiating reorders, receiving new stock, and analyzing data for optimization.

Sub-Problems.
1. Sales Tracking. Implement a system to track sales and update stock levels accordingly.
2. Reorder Point Calculation. Determine the reorder point for each product based on historical sales data, lead time, and safety stock level.
3. Reordering Process: Generate purchase orders for products that need to be restocked, considering reorder quantities based on demand and lead time.

Sub-Solutions.
1. Sales Tracking Solution.
   - Implement a function to record sales and update stock levels.
   - Input. Product SKU sold quantity
   - Output. Update stock levels

2. Re-order Point Calculation Solution.
   - Implement a function to calculate the reorder point for a product.
   - Input. Product SKU
   - Output. Reorder point

3. Re-ordering Process Solution.
   - Implement a function to generate a purchase order for products that need restocking.
   - Input. List of products below reorder point
   - Output. Purchase order information

2. Necessary Functions.

Sales Tracking Solution.
function record sale(SKU, quantity)
     Update stock levels based on sold quantity
    product = get product by SKU(SKU)
    product. Stock level -= quantity
    update product(product)

Re-order Point Calculation Solution:
function calculate re-order point(SKU)
     calculate re-order points based on historical sales data, lead time, and safety stock level
    Product = get product by sku(sku)
    Re-order point = product. Average sales per day * product. Lead time + product. Safety stock
    Return re-order point

Re-ordering Process Solution.
function generate purchase order(products below re-order)
     Generate a purchase order for products that need restocking
    Purchase order = { }
    For product in products_below_re-order
        Re-order quantity = calculate re-order quantity(product.sku)
        Purchase order[product.sku] = re-order quantity
    Return purchase order

3. Defining variables.

Sales Tracking Solution.
- sku= string, the Stock Keeping Unit of the product
- =quantity= integer, the quantity sold

Re-order Point Calculation Solution.
- sku= string, the Stock Keeping Unit of the product

Re-ordering Process Solution.
- Products below re-order= list of products that need to be restocked
